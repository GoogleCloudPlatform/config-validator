# Config Validator

[![OSS-Fuzz Status](https://oss-fuzz-build-logs.storage.googleapis.com/badges/config-validator.svg)](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?sort=-opened&can=1&q=proj:config-validator)

This is a Golang library which provides functionality to evaluate
GCP resources against Rego-based policies. It can be used to add
config policy support to new projects without having to integrate
Rego parsing directly.

For information on setting up Config Validator to secure your environment,
see the [User Guide](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/policy-library/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md).
